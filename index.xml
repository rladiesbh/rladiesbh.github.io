      <description>We have a meetup roughly every second month.
The content of our meetups varies:
 A mix of short talks of 5-20 minutes on a range of topics. For example: Favourite R packages, Applications for which you use R, The best way to learn R. This is an excellent opportunity for everyone to present what they are passionate about. How-tos/Tutorials of R-packages and applications. Are you an experienced in an R-related-topic that you would like to share and others to learn?</description>
